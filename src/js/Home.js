                <p> Welcome to our blessed league. We are a community of 9 upstanding men and 1 government-backed artifical intelligence program who like to play fantasy football with each other.</p>
                <p> Here you will find the home page of FTP Fantasy, which stands for #FuckThePetti. Named after Bryan Petti, who dominated the league in its inaugural season with a deadly 1-2 punch of LeSean McCoy and Jamaal Charles.</p>
                <p> Bards sing the tale of that fantasy team to this day.</p>
