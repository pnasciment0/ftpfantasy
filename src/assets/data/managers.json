      "bio": "Our resident ginger, Thomas Anzalone is among the most wholesome members not just of FTP, but the world at large. Thomas has been in FTP since its inception, and despite his reputation as a perennial contender and fierce competitor, has never brought home the coveted first place trophy. He is known for his patented \"Fuck RBs\" strategy and is an absolute shark on the waiver wire. Thomas resides in Orlando, FL with his much cooler girlfriend, kick ass rig, cushy government job, and way too many 5 and 7km eggs."
